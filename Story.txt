This ain't a song for a broken-hearted. This is a tale about making ones own destiny.

The story is about a fighter pilot, an intuitive secret agent, an official, and a hateful beastmaster. It takes place in a world-spanning nation on a war-scarred planet. The story begins with the preparation for a performance and ends with an adoration.

It starts in a gun shop in a manufacturing city. Archaeology versus respecting native cultures plays a major role in this story.

It was a bright day in May. There was no customer in the gun shop in that bright sunny day.

In the shop, a lovable new girl and she has everybody talking. Stunningly smart and devastatingly fat, all the boys want her. However, Jenny Williams has a secret - she's a snotty vampire.

Cameron Clifford is an intelligent, pale boy who enjoys star gazing. He becomes fascinated by Jenny who can stop meteors with her bare hands. He doesn't understand why she's so standoffish.

His best friend, a cute goblin called Mildred, helps Cameron begin to piece together the puzzle. Together, they discover the ultimate weapon - the blue, bendy knife.

When bodies start turning up all over the city, Cameron begins to fear the worst. The goblin urges her to report Jenny to the police and he knows he should, so what's stopping him?

He may resist Jenny's bite, but can he resist her charms?

Will he be caught partying with the vampire?

Thanks to strange technology, the characters end up in in hell.

"If happy-ever-after did exist, I would still be holding you like this," the young woman said.

"But," replied her admirer Cameron, "All those fairy tales are full of it! One more stupid love song, and I'll be sick!"

Rumors had it that they were still at the payphone.
