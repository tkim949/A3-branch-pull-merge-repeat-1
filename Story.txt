This is a tale about making ones own destiny. The story is about a fighter pilot, an intuitive secret agent, an official, and a hateful beastmaster. It takes place in a world-spanning nation on a war-scarred planet. The story begins with the preparation for a performance and ends with an adoration.
 It starts in a gun shop in a manufacturing city. Archaeology versus respecting native cultures plays a major role in this story.

It was a bright day in May, 1880. There was no customer in the gun shop in that bright sunny day.
